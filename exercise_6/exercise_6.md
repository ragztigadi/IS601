# Exercise 6

Alice is designing a prefix notation adding machine.

This machine uses parentheses and the plus sign to designate two arguments to add together.

Arguments must either be integers or another addition operation.

For example:

```lisp
(+ 1 1)          ; (1)
(+ 1 2)          ; (2)
(+ 2 (+ 3 3))    ; (3)
```

1. **In what function are you getting an error?**

   - `get_argument`

2. **What function called the function that's giving you an error?**

   - `perform_operation` called `get_argument`, which then encountered the error.

3. **How many function calls in total were there before the error occurred?**

   - There were **4** function calls before the error occurred.

4. **What is the type of error you're getting?**

   - `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'F'`

5. **Is the error a problem with the parser or its input?**

   - The error is a problem with the **input**, specifically the presence of the non-integer character `'F'`.

6. **If it's an input problem, how would you fix the input?**

   - To fix the input, replace `'F'` with a valid integer value. For example, change it to `(+ (+ 3 4) 5)`.

7. **If it's a parser problem, how would you fix the parser?**

   - If it were a parser problem, I would add validation to ensure all inputs to `get_argument` are valid integers or addition operations.

8. **How could you make the parser raise a `ParserError` if this happens again in the future?**

   - I could add a check in the `get_argument` function to verify that the arguments being converted to integers are valid numbers, and if not, raise a `ParserException`.

9. **How many arguments does the addition operation in Alice's machine take?**
   - The addition operation takes exactly **two arguments**.

# The right version of the code should be like this

**Correct code of this exercise 6:**

```python
class ParserException(Exception):
    pass

def find_open_parenthesis(text):
    for index, character in enumerate(text):
        if character == '(':
            return text[index + 1:]
    raise ParserException("Unable to find opening parenthesis")

def get_argument(text):
    start_index = None
    for index, character in enumerate(text):
        if character == '(':
            arg, remaining_text = perform_operation(text[index + 1:])
            return arg, remaining_text
        elif character != ' ' and start_index is None:
            start_index = index
        elif (character == ' ' or character == ')') and start_index is not None:
            arg_str = text[start_index:index]
            # Validate if arg_str is an integer
            try:
                arg = int(arg_str)
            except ValueError:
                raise ParserException(f"Invalid argument '{arg_str}' is not an integer.")
            remaining_text = text[index + 1:]
            return arg, remaining_text
    raise ParserException("Unable to get argument")

def perform_operation(text):
    if text[0] == '+':
        arg1, remaining_text = get_argument(text[1:])
        arg2, remaining_text = get_argument(remaining_text)
        return arg1 + arg2, remaining_text
    else:
        raise ParserException("Invalid operation")

try:
    result, _ = perform_operation(find_open_parenthesis("(+ (+ 1 2) (+ (+ 3 4) 5))"))
    print("Result:", result)
except ParserException as e:
    print("ParserException:", e)
```

## Markdown File Structure

1. **Exercise Title**: Clearly states the exercise being worked on.
2. **Error Analysis**: Thoroughly addresses each question about the error, function calls, and their origins.
3. **Corrected Code**: Provides a functional version of the parser that handles errors gracefully and ensures input validation.
